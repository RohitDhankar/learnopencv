1/ keypoints --->
keypoints, which are just the location of regions of interest. 
Keypoints are meant to identify salient regions of an input image.
Provided we have enough keypoint matches and correspondences, we can then compute a homography matrix, which allows us to apply a perspective warp to align the images

2/ descriptor --->>

1/ keypoints --->
keypoints or feature points. There are several keypoint detectors implemented in OpenCV ( e.g. SIFT, SURF, and ORB).
In many Computer Vision applications, we often need to identify interesting stable points in an image. These points are called keypoints or feature points.

2/ descriptor --->> 
Ideally, the same physical point in two images should have the same descriptor. ORB uses a modified version of the feature descriptor called BRISK.
